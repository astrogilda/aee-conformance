# Conformance suite changelog

The vector corpus is a versioned, immutable-per-revision artifact. A published
`suiteRevision` is never mutated in place; a normative change to the predicate
or a corpus addition bumps the revision and regenerates the vectors
byte-identically from the generators.

## suiteRevision 1 (first public release)

- Corpus: 125 vectors (34 accept, 91 reject) for the Adversarial Execution
  Evidence predicate v0.6, tracking in-toto/attestation#570 at commit `e5ea1eb`
  (which folds in the review revisions, including the BMP-only string profile
  and the optional arming-payload run-chaining members). `MANIFEST.json`
  enumerates every vector with its expected verdict, result, and code set.
- Each reject vector is broken exactly one way; each accept vector exercises a
  distinct valid shape.
- Notable coverage worth calling out for a reimplementer:
  - Canonicalization: a supplementary-plane `observationVocabulary.labels`
    entry (`bad-612-labels-non-bmp`, `vocabulary-not-canonical`) and a covering
    record payload whose member NAME carries a supplementary-plane code point
    (`bad-208-payload-member-non-bmp`, `payload-not-canonical`). Each stays
    byte-canonical under both the UTF-16 and the code-point member order, so the
    BMP-only rule is the single fault.
  - Type strictness: a caught row carrying `actualLayer` as a JSON number
    (`bad-506-actuallayer-json-number`, `statement-malformed`). A wrong-typed
    row member is a decode-layer fault, deliberately distinct from an absent
    member, so every rail rejects at the same altitude.
  - Run-chaining member syntax (`bad-718`/`bad-719`/`bad-720`,
    `arming-covers-nothing`): `aeeRunSeq` positive, `aeeChainScope` required
    whenever `aeeRunSeq` is present, and `aeePrevRunBinding` a lowercase 64-hex
    digest present exactly when `aeeRunSeq` exceeds 1. The genesis form is the
    accept vector `ok-034-arming-chain-genesis`.
  - Coverage partition: a whole manifest class left out of every coverage set
    with the result forced to pass (`bad-816-coverage-class-dropped`,
    `coverage-incomplete`) — the class-granularity fail-open.
  - Base64 canonicality: a record payload re-encoded as non-canonical base64
    (`bad-817-payload-noncanonical-base64`, `record-undecodable`). The Go rail
    decodes with `base64.StdEncoding.Strict()` and the Python rail
    re-encode-compares, so both reject where a lenient decoder would accept.
